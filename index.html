        <h1>anthello147.github.io</h1>
        <p>
            Software-related tutorials and articles, as well as some of my own
            (mostly) cross-platform programs.

        <p>
            The website design is based on <a href="https://unixsheikh.com">unixsheikh.com</a>,
            because it is a minimalistic, resource-efficient design which
            displays well on any browser, including text-based browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently this website doesn't have much stuff; I am planning on
            adding a whole bunch of basic tutorials for setting up and using
            software (e.g. installing Ubuntu, using the Unix shell) for those
            who might need them. I might also write some articles about software
            theory if I have time.
        </p>

            The website itself is hosted using GitHub Pages. The source
            repository is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/anthello147/anthello147.github.io">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have only two years experience in programming (mostly Python) and
            about a year of GNU/Linux system administration. Avid supporter of free
            open source software and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research Unix</a>.
            Unfortunately Unix is dead after the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars">commercial squabble</a>
            for the great system. Currently I am learning C and how Unix-like
            systems work so that perhaps I can make my own operating system one
            day (and revive Unix).
