        <h1>Install Python on a Chromebook with Miniconda</h1>
        <p class="dimmed">Published on 2020-10-22. Modified on 2021-03-28.</p>
        <p>
            If you're stuck with a Chromebook and you want to develop programs
            on it using Python while keeping Chrome OS, you can do so by
            installing Miniconda. However, to do any Python development on your
            Chromebook locally (without using the internet), you will need to
            activate Chrome OS Developer Mode. That being said, I strongly
            recommend you remove Chrome OS and install a proper operating
            system, such as GNU/Linux. It will save you much stress in the
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: For this tutorial I am using Chromium OS, the open-source
            version of Chrome OS. As such, the steps to install Python with
            Miniconda may slightly differ on the official Chrome OS.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, reboot the Chromebook and enter Developer Mode. Open the Crosh
            (<b>C</b>h<b>ro</b>me Developer <b>Sh</b>ell) and type in the
            command <code>shell</code> to access the hidden Bash shell (as I am
            using Chromium OS developer build, not Chrome OS, I do not need to
            enter a developer mode to access the Bash shell).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, remount <code>tmp</code> as exec (with executable permission):
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>$</b> sudo mount /tmp -o remount,exec</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            When prompted for a password, type in the password for user chronos.
            There are (apparently) several different possible default passwords
            for <code>chronos</code>, including <code>facepunch</code>,
            <code>password</code>, <code>chrome</code>, <code>localhost</code>,
            <code>test0000</code>, and a blank password (nothing). In my case it
            was <code>chrome</code>. If you are using an official Chromebook and
            have booted into Developer Mode, you should have set a password with
            <code>chromeos-setdevpasswd</code> when enabling Developer Mode (for
            more information click
            <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelslate/thread/983473?hl=en&msgid=1005143">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, download the Miniconda installation script for Linux
            from the
            <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Conda website</a>
            (remember to download the 64-bit version though), change the working
            directory to the location of the downloaded Miniconda installation
            script file, run it, and change the install location to a location
            with write privileges (in my case <code>/usr/local/conda3</code>).
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>$</b> cd ~/Downloads</code><br>
            <code><b>$</b> sudo bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -p /usr/local/conda3</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            When installation finishes, you must add your Conda installation to PATH:
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>$</b> echo "PATH=/usr/local/conda3/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            Restart the Crosh and enter the Bash shell again. Verify that the
            directory of the installed Conda binaries is in PATH with
            <code>echo $PATH</code> and if <code>/usr/local/conda3/bin</code>
            is in PATH, verify that Python is installed with
            <code>python3 --version</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you can install other modules. The installation of Miniconda
            includes the package manager Conda which specifically installs
            Python packages (however, there are some other packages available
            in Conda, such as GCC). Using Conda, you can install Tkinter,
            PyInstaller, and many other Python packages:
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>$</b> conda install -c anaconda tk</code><br>
            <code><b>$</b> conda install -c anaconda pyinstaller</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            Installing PyInstaller works, but it appears that on Chromium OS,
            there is no such tool as <code>objcopy</code>, meaning that
            PyInstaller cannot compile any Python scripts, and, as explained
            in the PyInstaller requirements, <code>ldd</code>,
            <code>objcopy</code>, and <code>objdump</code> must be installed
            for PyInstaller to work on Linux installations. The workaround for
            this is to compile Python scripts with PyInstaller on another Linux
            computer and then run the compiled script on Chrome/Chromium OS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, on newer versions of Chromium OS, graphical Python
            applications (made with Tkinter, PyQt, etc.) don't run because they
            don't recognise the system DISPLAY environment variable. The problem
            is that the entire graphical display of Chrome/Chromium OS is
            controlled by the Google Chrome web browser program and the web
            browser runs with no DISPLAY variable, meaning that any GUI program
            started in the OS by the user (meaning that it would be started by
            the Chrome browser) would start with no DISPLAY variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workaround is to set the DISPLAY variable for the Chrome
            browser. To do this, you will need to login as root with the command
            <code>sudo su</code>, as Crosh does not allow editing the file you
            will need to edit, even with the <code>sudo</code> command. After
            logging in as root with <code>sudo su</code>, you will need to run
            the following commands:
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>#</b> mount -o remount,rw /dev/root /</code><br>
            <code><b>#</b> echo "DISPLAY=:0" >> /etc/chrome_dev.conf</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            Then reboot, and now you should be able to run graphical Python
            programs as well as console Python programs.
