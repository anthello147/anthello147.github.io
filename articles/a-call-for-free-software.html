        <h1>A call for free software</h1>
        <p class="dimmed">Published on 2021-05-20.</p>
        <p>
            Every person in this world who has used a computer has been using
            non-free software, software designed to take away the freedoms of
            its users. Have you used Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel? Have you
            used Google Search? What about Microsoft Windows, Apple's macOS, a
            commercial antivirus, Adobe Photoshop, Google Chrome, drivers for
            NVIDIA graphics cards, a computer with a closed-source BIOS/UEFI
            (literally every computer), a computer with an Intel processor?
            These are only a few examples of non-free software. Have you used
            any of the above software? Most certainly you have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's step back a bit. What constitutes free or non-free software?
            In this article I will not be referring to 'free' as in money,
            like 'free food', but free as in freedom, like 'free speech'.
        </p>
        <p>
            You would have, most certainly, have heard about how different
            programs, devices, and online services which track you, collect
            personal data, and in other ways limit or flout your freedoms. These
            are all examples of non-free software. Such software may hide itself
            behind a paywall, send diagnostic data to its creators (and often
            third parties), stop working at specified points in time, require
            you to make an account, require your personal information (name,
            email address, phone number, credit card details, etc.), or other
            things along those lines. Such software might impose restrictions on
            your use of it and may restrict you from removing certain features,
            modifying it, etc. Windows, for example, doesn't let you uninstall
            Internet Explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, free software is software that allows you to modify it,
            disable and enable what you wish, and use it as you want to, without
            taking away any of your freedoms, such as your privacy or your right
            to do whatever you want with the software. Great examples are the
            GNU/Linux operating system, GNOME Maps, and LibreOffice.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my experience, free and open-source software works much better
            than non-free software. This is because free software has no
            gigantic pieces of code designed to track you and/or make sure that
            you have paid for the said software. And the nature of open-source
            software is such that the source code of the program is available
            for anyone to examine and point out problems and bugs, which are
            usually then fixed by the software developers. This is why I find
            free and open-source software superior to the proprietary
            counterparts, which are usually slow and laggy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GNU project, backed by the Free Software Foundation, was started
            in response to the fact that closed-source proprietary non-free
            software was prevalent (and still is) in the world. This started off
            with the creation of the GNU operating system (an operating system
            is the system that runs your computer and what all of your apps run
            on), which was incomplete until it was combined with the Linux kernel
            (a kernel is the core of an operating system). This resulted with
            GNU/Linux, an free and open-source operating system that is gaining
            more and more popularity amongst the tech community. It is widely
            used in servers (all those computers which make the Web work run on
            Linux) due to the fact that it has much less bugs and works much
            better than, let's say, Windows Server. 90% of cloud infrastructure
            in the world, including supercomputers, run on Linux. And because it
            is free for anyone to use, modify, and redistribute, most
            smartphones, routers, and servers run on Linux or forks of Linux.
            Such is the power of free software.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may be wondering how you can avoid non-free software and switch
            to the better, free software alternatives. Here are a few
            alternatives that I recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>DuckDuckGo</h3>
                <p>
                    DuckDuckGo is a free search engine, which you can use as a
                    replacement for Google Search. It still provides good
                    search results, and has many of Google Search's features
                    (such as word definitions). Although it comes with
                    advertisements enabled by default, you can disable these in
                    DuckDuckGo's
                    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">settings</a>.
                    Also, unlike Google Search, it comes with a dark theme
                    which you can also toggle at any time (which can help your
                    eyes).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>LibreOffice</h3>
                <p>
                    I find LibreOffice to be a great replacement for Microsoft
                    Office. LibreOffice Writer, for example, is much faster to
                    put your keystrokes down onto your document than Microsoft
                    Word. Also, LibreOffice Writer is compatible with Word
                    documents, even if it does sometimes mess up the formatting
                    slightly. LibreOffice Calc is a great alternative to
                    Microsoft Excel. Just like Writer, it is compatible with
                    Excel spreadsheets. A unique thing about LibreOffice that
                    you won't find in Microsoft Office is LibreOffice Draw.
                    Essentially you can add text boxes, shapes, symbols, and
                    arrange them however you like. You could create drawings,
                    fancy documents, sketches, and more. I highly recommend
                    giving LibreOffice a try, even if you don't want to switch.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>GIMP</h3>
                <p>
                    A brilliant alternative to Adobe Photoshop. Both are hard
                    to master, but come with a wide range of different tools
                    which allow you to edit images however you want to. Unlike
                    it's Adobe counterpart, GIMP is free, and is actually
                    created by the GNU project (GIMP stands for GNU Image
                    Manipulation Program). If you are tired of the unusability
                    of Microsoft Paint this might also be an option if you're
                    willing to learn a lot about using GIMP.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to remove the proprietary blobs of Windows or
                    macOS, you might want to give Linux a shot. Linux is a great
                    operating system. Although it doesn't come as one complete
                    operating system (I wish it was), it comes in a variety of
                    so-called distributions. These distributions contain the
                    operating system and all the software that you would need to
                    manage your system. Different distributions are suited for
                    different needs. For most people who simply want a working
                    system, Ubuntu is a great replacement for Windows or macOS,
                    especially with a few tweaks. Personally I use tweaked
                    Ubuntu as one of my systems (because it has a lot of
                    software compatibility). This is what I would recommend for
                    most people. If you think you are a Linux master, though, I
                    would recommend a system which truly respects your freedoms
                    and runs much more smoothly, like Alpine Linux. For
                    beginners, setting up Alpine would be an overkill though,
                    as you would need to setup everything from the graphical
                    interface to audio to automated disk management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are really willing to stretch yourself in the
                    technologies field, trying Ubuntu might be worth it. It
                    isn't for everyone though, as it is rather difficult for
                    someone who has no idea on the underlying concepts of how
                    operating systems work.
                </p>

            It is really important that people take back computing in their
            hands. As companies strive to generate as much revenue as possible
            by selling consumers' data to third parties, keeping software
            closed-source, and mass-producing software without checking for code
            quality, it is only up to the user's to choose between free and
            non-free software.
