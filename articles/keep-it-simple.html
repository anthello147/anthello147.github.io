        <h1>Keep It Simple, Stupid</h1>
        <p class="dimmed">Published on 2021-05-30.</p>
        <p>
            Too many things in everyday life, around the world, are made overly
            complicated, sometimes for no reason at all. It makes things hard to
            understand and navigate. It introduces problems, wastes time, gives
            stress, and over time these problems accumulate, and the greater
            complexity grows, the more these problems grow. It becomes
            impossible to manage or control anything, and in the end it is
            probably better to start anything that has spiralled out of control
            due to the sheer complexity anew.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is seen time and time again in almost all software in existence.
            As more and more
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">features creep into the code</a>,
            the software becomes more and more complex. It becomes much more
            difficult to manage, harder to navigate, harder to read, harder to
            understand. Security issues are overlooked, bugs and other issues
            become harder to find and diagnose. The software developers (often
            frontend developers do this) push in more and more features,
            thinking that it makes end users' lives easier, that it will
            increase compatibility for other software and platforms, and other,
            similar traps. Sometimes developers will even add new features for
            absolutely nonsensical things like for the sake of change, or
            because they think that the piece of software is not advanced
            enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then it gets so out of control that the software is so bloated
            that it <i>really</i> starts to affect end users. I'm not even
            talking about software like Mozilla Firefox, which, although is, in
            my experience, way too bloated, the quality of today's hardware is
            enough to sustain Firefox in a way that makes the end user not
            notice the horrible bloat in Firefox. I'm talking about software
            which is so bloated that it is visibly noticeable on good hardware,
            like most websites on the Internet if your web browser runs the
            JavaScript they burden your computer with. They simply lag so much
            that a lot of the time they don't load, or take a <i>really</i>
            long time to load.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's not to say bloated software like Firefox isn't inexcusable.
            In fact, most bloatware developers (that is correct, <i>bloatware
            developers</i>) always have the excuse that 'it doesn't matter if
            software is bloated, modern hardware will support it'. From first
            glance it is obvious to any person, technology-based background or
            not, that this is utter stupidity. Software should not be designed
            or made poorly in the first place. Making excuses for poor decisions
            is not good either. Software should be kept as simple as possible,
            for both the makers, other developers, and the end user, so that
            everyone would be happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A typical end user who is not familiar with the severity of this
            problem can't simply imagine how bad the situation is without a
            clear representation in front of them. Let me give you an example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say you were sitting at a console (in Windows, this can be
            the Command Prompt, on macOS and Linux this can be the Terminal),
            where any interaction is done using what is called a CLI, or a
            <i>command-line interface</i>. You are given a prompt (in the
            example below it is the '$' symbol), and usually, there is a
            blinking cursor and you can type commands. Upon hitting the
            enter/return key, the command executes, placing any output below,
            like the <code>echo</code> command:
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code><b>$</b> echo Hello, World!</code><br>
            <code>Hello, World!</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            As shown in the above example, the <code>echo</code> command does
            one simple thing: output everything written in the line below. In
            the C programming language, the program for the <code>echo</code>
            command would look as simple as like this:
        </p>
        <div class="plain">
            <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code><br>
            <code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</code><br><br>
            <code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</code><br>
            <code>{</code><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)</code><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</code><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(argv[i]);</code><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (i != argc - 1) putchar(' ');</code><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br><br>
            <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;putchar('\n');</code><br>
            <code>}</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            Simple, easy to read, and no harm done! A simple 13 lines for a
            simple program. However, the same command is somehow 32 lines in
            OpenBSD, 112 lines in FreeBSD, and a whopping 273 in the GNU
            project! The GNU version so big that I didn't want to include it in
            this article. Want to see? Here is the link:
            <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/echo.c">https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/echo.c</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horrendous! Do you <i>really</i> need that much code for a simple
            command that outputs a line of text? Really? And to think - every
            piece of software in your computer is inflated to such massive
            sizes and then topped up with so much bloat that your hardware
            starts complaining. Complexity is the bane of all software, and
            lots of software grows and grows to insane sizes.
            This makes life hard for both the makers, other developers, and the
            end users. Software developers should really reconsider how they
            develop software, and should really focus on efficiency, code
            readability, and above all, and this is most important - simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep it simple, stupid.
